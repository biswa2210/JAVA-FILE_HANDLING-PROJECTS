## About :point_down: 

<div align="justified">
 
A student information system (SIS), student management system, school administration software or student administration system is a management information system for education establishments used to manage student data. Student information systems provide capabilities for registering students in courses; documenting grading, transcripts of academic achievement and co-curricular activities, and the results of student assessment scores; forming student schedules; tracking student attendance; and managing other student-related data needs in an educational institution. Information security is a concern, as universities house an array of sensitive personal information, making them potentially attractive targets for security breaches, such as those experienced by retail corporations or healthcare providers. Student management system is an environment where all the process of the student in the institution is managed. It is done through the automated computerized method. Conventionally this system is done using papers, file and binders. This system saves the time of the student and of the administrator. It includes process like registration of the student’s details, assigning the department based on their course and maintenance of the record. This system reduces the cost and workforce required for this job. As the system is online the information is globally present to everyone. This makes the system easy to handle and feasible for finding the omission with updating at the same time. As for the existing system, they use to maintain their record manually which makes it vulnerable to security. If filed a query to search or update in a manual system, it will take a lot of time to process the query and make a report which is a tedious job. As the system used in the institute is outdated as it requires paper, files and the binders, which will require the human workforce to maintain them. To get registered in the institute, a student in this system one should come to the university. Get the forms from the counter while standing in the queue which consumes a lot of the student’s time as well as of management team. As the number of the student increases in the institute manually managing the strength becomes a hectic job for the administrator. This computerized system store all the data in the database which makes it easy to fetch and update whenever needed.

## The Records Consist :point_down:

 - ADD STUDENT<br>
 - SHOW ALL STUDENTS<br>
 - FIND STUDENT<br>
 - DELETE STUDENT<br>
 - EXIT<br>

## Purpose :point_down:

<div align="justified">

It describes aspects of the system that are concerned with how the system provides the functional requirements. They are:
a.	Security: <br>
The subsystem should provide a high level of security and integrity of the data held by the system, only authorized personnel of the system can gain access to the system’s secured page on the system. <br>
b.	Performance and Response Time: <br>
The system should have high performance rate when executing user’s input and should be able to provide the response within a short time span usually seconds for highly complicated task and 20 to 25 seconds for less complicated task. <br>
c.	Error handling: <br>
Error should be considerably minimized and an appropriate error message that guides the user to recover from an error should be provided. Validation of user’s input is highly essential. Also the standard time taken to recover from an error should be 15 to 20 seconds. <br>
d.	Availability:  <br>
This system should always be available for access at 24 hours, 7 days a week. Also in the occurrence of any major system malfunctioning, the system should be available in 1 to 2 working days, so that the business process is not severely affected. <br>
e.	Ease of use: <br>
Considered the level of knowledge possessed by the user of this system, a simple but quality user interface should be developed to make it easy to understand and required less training.  <br>

## Use :point_down:

<div align="justified">
 
Here we can choose option.
a.	Adding Students:  <br>
All the required students’ details containing their name, roll number, enrolment number, registration number, phone number, city are added when we choose option 1 in menu. <br>
b.	Displaying Whole Record: <br>
All the added records are stored in a database and are fetched and showed when we choose option 3 in menu. <br>
c.	Searching Particular Customer Information: <br>
We can choose option 4 when we want to search a particular student’s record. We have to give the enrolment number of that student to get that student’s details. <br>
d.	Deleting Records: <br>
When we want to delete a student’s record we have to choose option 2 and give that student’s id no. Then that record will be deleted. <br>
e.	Exit Program: <br>
If we want to exit the program we have to choose option 5. Then the program will be closed. <br>
We have used Idea Intellij Software for java. <br>

## Making :point_down:

I have made this project using Java Programming Language. Here I have created the functionalities. Here the record is created in a record.txt file. When we delete or update a record then the older file get deleted and new file is created here. I have used Idea Inteelij for java.
